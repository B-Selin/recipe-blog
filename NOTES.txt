** HOW TO CREATE THE RECIPES PAGE WITH THE LIST OF ALL THE RECIPES

1- Createw a route in routes/recipes.js to handle the index page:

 // GET /recipes 
router.get('/', recipesCtrl.index);

2- Define the index controller function in controllers/recipes.js :
the render link has to have the '/index' at the end, because 'recipes/index' is the ejs file that we are listing all the recipes

async function index(req, res) {
  const recipes = await Recipe.find({});
  res.render('recipes/index', { recipes });
}

This queries the Recipe model for all recipes, and passes them to the index view.

3- Create the index view at views/recipes/index.ejs :

<!-- Loop through recipes and display -->
<% recipes.forEach(function(r) { %>
  <li><%= r.title %></li>  
<% }) %>

This loops through the recipes data and displays the title of each one. We are going to change this into an href later

4- Import the recipes router in server.js:

const recipesRouter = require('./routes/recipes');

app.use('/recipes', recipesRouter); 

This will handle the routes

5- Add a link to the index page in views/partials/header.ejs so when a user clicks this link, it will send a GET request to /recipes.:

<a href="/recipes">All Recipes</a>
